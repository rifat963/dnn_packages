There is many way to execute your script :

launch bash with root privilege sudo bash install.sh

change permissions to launch the script. However be careful, it's an installation script, it may require root privileges. So you must probably run it as root.

chmod +x install.sh or chmod 755 install.sh

or

just sudo run.sh



docker image rm [IMAGE ID] [IMAGE ID]
